    Dear Diary!
> Today I'm starting one of you over again. I probably will want to look back at this later, so the day when I'm writing this is the 14th of March, 2280.
> Today my teacher assigned us to make a project about our friends. So to be the best of the best I'm making a Website with their profiles. I'll also add a litle game there, so it'd be more interesting. I hope my classmates like it and Mr.Orange is proud of me!

    Dear Diary!
> My classmates found my super Website weird and scary. Still they liked how much effort I put in, so I got a good grade and my friends were happy!!
> For the grade I got my mum let me invite my friends hang out in our house all alone!! We were really happy about it. Even my little sis joined! We watched films and laughed a lot. I hope I can get a good grade again so we can have fun together.
